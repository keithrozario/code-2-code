This code runs on Java, and is deployed via Docker.

I want to extract the User Journeys and Features of the code, and build out a requirements document that might have been used to create the code. Focus over the following sections:

1. Monitor of your financial situation.
2. Track your incomes & expenses.
3. Finance Record File
4. Support Multiple Book
5. Support Multiple Currency

Create a section called "User Journeys" in the final report, and populate the section with the following details of each journey. Be as detailed as possible, as you are a senior business analyst analyzing this code base.

## Core Interactions

Describes the Core interactions from the user with the journey, describing each stage from where the user came from.

## Business requirements

Detailed requirements that the program implements in it's functionality.

## Example user flow 

An Example user flow that the user goes through. Include at least 1 user flow in this section.
