# Functional Specification: Customized Reporting Module

## 1. Purpose of the Document

This document provides the detailed functional specifications for the implementation of a new **Customized Reporting Module** for the MoneyNote application. The existing application provides robust capabilities for tracking financial data, but its reporting features are static and run directly against the transactional database, which poses a performance risk.

This specification formalizes the requirements for a new, flexible reporting engine that will empower users to create, save, and view personalized financial reports. It will serve as the single source of truth for the development, quality assurance, and project management teams, ensuring that the final product aligns with business objectives and user needs. This document is based on the analysis of the existing application architecture, data layer, and core user journeys.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

The primary goal of the Customized Reporting Module is to **enable users to derive meaningful, personalized insights from their financial data through flexible and powerful data visualization tools.**

To achieve this goal, the system will meet the following objectives:

*   **Empower User-Driven Analysis:** Allow users to build custom reports by selecting from a range of financial dimensions (e.g., categories, tags, payees) and metrics (e.g., total income, average spending).
*   **Provide Advanced Filtering:** Enable users to precisely scope their reports using comprehensive filtering options, including date ranges, specific books, accounts, and more.
*   **Enhance Data Visualization:** Offer multiple visualization formats, such as pie charts, bar charts, and data tables, allowing users to interpret their financial data in the most effective way.
*   **Improve Reusability:** Provide the functionality for users to save their custom report configurations, allowing for quick and easy access to frequently viewed reports.
*   **Ensure Architectural Integrity:** Seamlessly integrate with the application's existing multi-book and multi-currency architecture, ensuring all reports are accurate and consistent by leveraging the established data model.
*   **Optimize Application Performance:** Architecturally separate the analytical workload of the reporting module from the primary transactional database to ensure that generating complex reports does not degrade the performance of core bookkeeping operations.

## 3. Scope

This section defines the boundaries of the Customized Reporting Module project.

### In Scope:

*   **Report Builder UI:** Development of a new user interface where users can define the parameters, filters, and visualization style for their custom reports.
*   **Report Viewer:** A dedicated screen to display the generated reports, including interactive charts and data tables.
*   **Report Management:** Functionality for users to save, name, update, and delete their custom report configurations.
*   **Backend Data Aggregation:** Implementation of the backend services required to query, aggregate, and process the data for the reports. This includes leveraging a separate, optimized data store for analytical queries.
*   **Core Reporting Dimensions:** The ability to generate reports based on the following core entities:
    *   Income and Expenses (`BalanceFlow`)
    *   Categories
    *   Tags
    *   Payees
*   **Filtering Capabilities:** The ability to filter reports by:
    *   Date Range (pre-defined and custom)
    *   Book(s)
    *   Account(s)
    *   Transaction Type (Income, Expense)
*   **Visualization Options:** Initial support for the following chart types:
    *   Pie Chart
    *   Bar Chart
    *   Data Table

### Out of Scope:

The following features will not be included in the initial release of the Customized Reporting Module but may be considered for future versions:

*   **Report Exporting:** Exporting custom reports to external formats such as PDF, CSV, or Excel.
*   **Report Sharing:** Sharing custom report configurations or results with other users within a `Group`.
*   **Real-Time Dashboards:** Dashboards that update automatically in real-time. All reports will be generated on-demand by the user.
*   **Financial Forecasting:** Any predictive analysis or forecasting based on historical data.
*   **Mobile-Specific UI:** A dedicated, optimized interface for creating reports on mobile devices. The initial release will focus on a desktop-first responsive design.
