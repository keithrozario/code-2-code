PROMPT_TEXT="You are an expert code analyst. Analyze the repository at '$REPO_PATH'.

Your task is to scan the entire repository for evidence of asynchronous processing. Look for:

1.  Usage of message queue clients (like RabbitMQ, Kafka, SQS).
2.  Usage of background job libraries (like Celery, Sidekiq).
3.  Framework-specific asynchronous annotations (like \`@Async\` in Spring).

For each instance you find, identify the function that produces the message/job and, if possible, the function that consumes/handles it. Please structure your findings clearly.

Your response must begin directly with the Markdown table and contain no introductory sentences."
