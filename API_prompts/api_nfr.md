Of course. I will start by searching the documentation for the terms 'performance', 'latency', 'scalability', 'security standards', 'SLO', and 'SLA'.I found no mentions of the keywords in the documentation. Now, I will analyze the project's configuration files.Based on my analysis of the repository, here is a breakdown of findings related to non-functional requirements:

### Documentation Analysis

I searched all `.md` and `.txt` files for keywords such as 'performance', 'latency', 'scalability', 'security standards', 'SLO', and 'SLA'. No results were found in the documentation.

### Configuration Analysis

| Category | File | Setting | Value | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Performance** | `src/main/resources/application.properties` | `spring.datasource.type` | `com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariDataSource` | The project uses HikariCP, a high-performance JDBC connection pool. |
| | `src/main/resources/application.properties` | `spring.jpa.open-in-view` | `false` | Disabling the "Open Session in View" pattern is a performance best practice, preventing lazy-loading issues in the view layer. |
| | `src/main/resources/application.properties` | `spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.jdbc.batch_size` | `50` | Enables JDBC batch updates, which can significantly improve the performance of bulk data insertion and updates. |
| | `src/main/resources/application.properties` | `spring.jpa.properties.jakarta.persistence.sharedCache.mode` | `NONE` | Disables the JPA second-level cache. This can be a performance-conscious choice for applications with high write-to-read ratios or where stale data is a concern. |
| | `src/main/resources/hibernate.properties` | `hibernate.dialect.storage_engine` | `myisam` | The MyISAM storage engine is configured for Hibernate. MyISAM is generally faster for read-heavy workloads but lacks support for transactions, which can be a critical trade-off. |
| **Scalability** | `Dockerfile` | `FROM ubuntu:23.04` ... `openjdk-17-jre` | - | The application is containerized using Docker, which is a fundamental technology for building scalable and portable applications. The use of a JRE instead of a full JDK creates a smaller image. |
| | `docker-compose.yml` | `services: moneynote-api:` | - | The `docker-compose.yml` file defines the application as a service, making it easy to orchestrate and scale, potentially with a load balancer in a production environment. |
| **Security** | `build.gradle` | `implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-security'` | - | The project includes Spring Security, a powerful and highly customizable authentication and access-control framework. |
| | `build.gradle` | `implementation 'com.auth0:java-jwt:4.2.1'` | - | The use of the `java-jwt` library indicates that the application likely uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for securing API endpoints. |
| | `src/main/resources/application.properties` | `spring.datasource.hikari.maxLifeTime` | `600000` (10 minutes) | Sets the maximum lifetime for a connection in the pool. This helps to prevent connections from being held open for excessively long periods. |
| | `src/main/resources/application.properties` | `spring.data.web.pageable.max-page-size` | `100` | By limiting the maximum page size for pagination, the application protects itself from requests that could consume excessive memory and lead to denial-of-service vulnerabilities. |
| | `src/main/resources/application.properties` | `server.tomcat.max-http-form-post-size` | `100MB` | Limits the maximum size of an HTTP POST request, which can help to prevent denial-of-service attacks that involve sending large amounts of data. |
| | `src/main/resources/application.properties` | `spring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size` | `100MB` | Limits the maximum size of a multipart request (typically used for file uploads), another measure to prevent denial-of-service attacks. |
| | `src/main/resources/application.properties` | `spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size` | `100MB` | Limits the maximum size of a single uploaded file. |
